            Hello! My name is Keen Renzo Ballon and I am based in Malabon, Metro Manila.
            A software developer with main focus is on Back-end Development and
            Systems Administration. I love the idea of intermediating between development and operations side of the tech industry, automating my way through it as much as possible.
